Javascript is a Dynamically Typed Language:
- You don't tell the engine what type of data a variable holds, it figures it  out while your code runs. 
- The variables can hold different values and types, which are decided during execution.

### Primitive Types in JS:
- Primitive Type: a type of data that holds/represents a single value. That is not an object.
  1. undefined - represents lack of existence (you shouldn't set a variable to this)
  2. null - this also represents a lack of existence (you can set a variable to this value)
  3. boolean - true/false
  4. number - floating point number (there are always some decimals), unlike other programming languages, there is only one number type.
  5. string - sequence of characters, both ' and " can be used.
  6. symbol - used in es6
## Coercion
Coercion means converting a value from one type to another
